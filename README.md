#  Crop Monitoring and Management using Machine Learning

A web-based application built with **Flask** that helps monitor agricultural parameters like **soil moisture**, **crop yield**, and **climate conditions** using machine learning models.

# Overview

This project enables smart agriculture through machine learning by predicting key environmental and crop-related factors. It assists farmers and agri-professionals in making data-driven decisions for effective crop planning and management.

# Features

- Predict soil moisture based on historical and synthetic data.
-  Forecast crop yield using linear regression models.
-  Climate condition prediction module (temperature, humidity trends).
-  Web dashboard built with Flask and HTML/CSS.
-  RESTful APIs for model interaction.
  
# Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression
- **API:** RESTful architecture
